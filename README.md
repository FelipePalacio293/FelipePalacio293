## Projects

#### Georeferencial-DataBase: Tracking Ancestral Lineage with Oracle and Python

Repository: [Georeferencial-DataBase](https://github.com/FelipePalacio293/Georeferencial-DataBase)

**Description:**

Welcome to the Georeferencial-DataBase repository! This project is an Oracle database designed to track the ancestral lineage of a village in Colombia. The database consists of a variety of triggers, functions, and procedures, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval. The main table features an auto-referential relationship, representing the connections between ancestors and descendants.

In addition to the Oracle database, this project includes Python scripts for georeferencing the individuals currently living in the village. By incorporating geospatial data, the project enables users to visualize ancestral relationships and lineage patterns in a geographical context.

**Key features:**

Oracle database implementation with a well-structured schema
Auto-referential relationship in the main table to represent ancestral connections
Triggers, functions, and procedures to facilitate efficient data management
Python scripts for georeferencing individuals, integrating geospatial data into the analysis
Visualization of lineage patterns and relationships within a geographical context
Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out or open an issue.
